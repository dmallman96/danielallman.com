Here are a few that I am currently working on:  \n\n\nCan invertebrates feel pain?\nHumans have long thought that pain and suffering was an experience unique to us. Recently, however, we have realised that other animals such as non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans respond to noxious stimuli in a way that is consistent with the idea of pain and suffering. Insects are absent from this list, which is peculiar as they compose over 75% of all named species in the world and remain understudied in the field of pain and sentience. I am interested in exploring the idea of sentience and the subjective experience of pain in insects using their behavioural responses to noxious stimuli.  \n\n\n\nINSERT PHOTO OF INSECT GROOMING HERE!\n\n\n \n\n\nHow and why insects jump\nYou might think that jumping is an easy behaviour to perform, but it is actually quite a challenge for insects, which are thousands of times smaller than we are. I am fascinated as to how insects jump frequently as they explore their world, catch prey, and escape predators despite the difficulty to execute such jumps. My findings were compiled in my Master of Research thesis with a cool discovery being that one group of Australian ants that were said to be incapable of jumping for the last 100 years were actually capable of leaping 3–4 cm to move about their environment efficiently.  \n\n\n\nThe first photograph of the Australian ant Myrmecia tarsata mid jump!"
