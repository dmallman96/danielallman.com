# About Me  
I'm Daniel, a PhD candidate from the University of Sydney, Australia, and this website is a test to slowly build my academic profile.

My interests lie in animal behaviour and evolution. More specifically, I love invertebrates and how they interact with the world around them depsite the obvious disadvantage of being small. Check out the projects tab to learn more about what I am interested in.
